Short note on the following topics:

# API (Application Programming Interface)
API is a set of rules and protocols that allow one software application to interact with another.
Used to enable third-party developers to integrate functionalities of one software into their own applications.

# SDK (Software Development Kit)
An SDK is a collection of tools, libraries, documentation, and sample code that helps developers build applications for a framework. SDKs typically include APIs, but they also provide additional resources such as debuggers and compilers.

# Web APIs
APIs designed to be accessed over the internet, using HTTP protocols.
They enable applications to communicate with web servers and interact with remote services or databases.

# Library APIs
A Library API allow developers to use pre-written code for specific tasks. It defines the functions and methods that can be called by developers to perform operations without needing to write the code from scratch.

# Prompting and Completion
**Prompting** refers to the process of providing input or instructions to the model to guide it in generating a response.
**Completion** is the output or result that the model generates based on the given prompt.
